  <h1>Weekend Rustic Ray Tracing - Part 2</h1>
  <article>
<section>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>If you're at all curious about ray tracing, I recommend starting with Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing Minibooks. In this
series of posts, I'll be converting the code in Ray Tracing in One Weekend (Book 1 in the series) to Rust. Rather than
rewrite Mr. Shirley's text, I'll be explaining my implementation choices.</p>
<p>Source code for this series is in <a href="https://github.com/ShonFrazier/raytracinginoneweekend">this repository</a>. Each
chapter has its own branch: <code>Chapter01</code>, <code>Chapter02</code>, etc. Each chapter branch is the completed code for that
chapter. The <code>master</code> branch will be the final renderer from the end of the book.</p>
<p>This little project will then be followed with some modifications to allow the code to render in a web browser.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2: The vec3 class</h3>
<p>Rust doesn't <em>do</em> classes, so we use a <code>struct</code> to hold the data for our three-dimensional vector. <code>Vec3</code>'s methods
match the methods from C++, with a minor exception: I've decided that <code>length()</code> should rely on <code>squared_length()</code> to
keep the code <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don&#x27;t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>. Finally, we write operations for our vector
using method implementations on each named operator.</p>
<p>This transliteration is fairly straightforward, but I've made some modifications. I don't care for the default
initialization syntax. This is easily remedied with another <code>new</code> method taking an array of three items, or three <code>f64</code>
arguments. Also, since we're using it to hold RGB values, rather than use the index operator on the vector, I'm calling
the color component methods.</p>
<p>There's one more change I've made: rather than multiply each component by 255.99, I'm scaling the vector and then
casting the components to <code>u8</code>. Not only do we repeast less code, but we also make use of the operators we implemented.</p>
